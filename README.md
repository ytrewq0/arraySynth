Antenna array synthesis algorithm integrated with HFSS.

AntennaArray.py - base classes for antenna arrays

ArraySynthesis.py - derived class for synthesis

ArrayPostProcessing.py - derived class for visualization

postProcess.py - example workflow for visualization

requirements.txt - used packages; when cloning from Github, PyCharm should install them automatically

simultSynthesize.py - example workflow, runs the simulatenous synthesis 
	
succSynthesize.py - example workflow, runs the successive synthesis
